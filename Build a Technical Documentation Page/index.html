            <p>React is a <code>declarative</code> , efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets
                you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.</p>

            <p> React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with React.Component subclasses:</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Inspecting">
            <header>Inspecting</header>
            <p>If you’re going to work on the tutorial in your browser,
                open this code in a new tab: Starter Code. If you’re going
                to work on the tutorial locally, instead open src/index.js
                in your project folder (you have already touched this file during
                the setup).</p>

            <p><code>This Starter Code</code> is the base of what we’re building. We’ve provided the
                CSS styling so that you only need to focus on learning React and
                programming the tic-tac-toe game.</p>

            <p>By inspecting the code, you’ll notice that we have three React components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Square</li>
                <li>Board</li>
                <li>Game</li>
                <li>Board</li>
                <li>Game</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Square component renders a single "button tag"
                and the Board renders 9 squares. The Game component renders a board
                with placeholder values which we’ll modify later. There are currently no
                interactive components.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Passing_Data">
            <header>Passing Data</header>
            <p>To get our feet wet, let’s try passing some data from our Board component to our Square component.</p>

            <p> We <code>strongly</code> recommend typing code by hand as you’re working through the tutorial and not using
                copy/paste.
                This will help you develop muscle memory and a stronger understanding.</p>

            <p> In Board’s <code>renderSquare</code> method, change the code to pass a prop called value to the Square:</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Making_Interactive">
            <header>Making Interactive</header>
            <p>React components can have state by setting this.state in their
                constructors. this.state should be considered as private to a React
                component that it’s defined in. Let’s store the current value of
                the Square in this.state, and change it when the Square is clicked.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Developer_Tools">
            <header>Developer Tools</header>
            <p>The React Devtools extension for Chrome and Firefox lets you inspect
                a React component tree with your browser’s developer tools.</p>
            <p>The React DevTools let you check
                the props and the state of your React components.</p>
                <h2>Note</h2>
                <p>In JavaScript classes, you need to always call super when defining the constructor of a subclass.
                    All React component classes that have a constructor should start with a super(props) call.</p>
            <p>After installing <code>React DevTools</code>, you can right-click on any
                element on the page, click “Inspect” to open the developer tools,
                and the React tabs (“⚛️ Components” and “⚛️ Profiler”) will appear
                as the last tabs to the right.
                Use “⚛️ Components” to inspect the component tree.</p>

                <li>Click the “Fork” button.</li>
                <li>Click “Change View” and then choose “Debug mode”.</li>
                <li>In the new tab that opens, the devtools should now have a React tab.</li>
